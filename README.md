![Part of the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree](https://img.shields.io/badge/Udacity-Front--End%20Web%20Developer%20Nanodegree-02b3e4.svg)

It is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The main objective of this project is implementing [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) testing. 
# Importance of this Project.

As my instructors at Udacity said that the Testing is an essential part of the development process and many companies practice a standard of development known as "test-driven-development". That means that developers developers write tests first even before they start developing any application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.


# Steps to run the application

  - To start the app, open index.html in your browser.
  - The tests were written in the feedreader.js file. The test results appears at the bottom of the index.html page.
  - Tests that are green have passed and red have failed.

### The test parts:

* each feed element inside allFeeds has a url key & url value isn't empty. 
* the allFeeds variable has been defined and not empty.
* the menu is hidden by default.
* the loadFeed function is called and completes its work.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Ziarellie/feed-reader-testing.git
```

* Open feed-reader-testing repository.
* Open index.html with your browser.
* There should be 8 specs, 0 failures at the bottom of the html page.
